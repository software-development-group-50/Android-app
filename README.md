# Nigiri falls - takeout application

An Android application ordered by the sushi restaurant Nigiri Falls to enable takeout from the restaurant. The application will be used by costumers to place orders from the restaurants three locations in Oslo, Trondheim and Bergen, and by the employees to review and edit orders.

## Running the application

The application can be run on an Android emulator or on an Android phone with API 26 or higher. To run the application go through the following steps:

### Install Android studio

At the moment, the only way to run the application is through Android studio. Download Android studio here: https://developer.android.com/studio/ and install it.

### Download repository and open it in Android Studio

Download the zip file for the project and extract it in your folder of choice for Android Studio projects (or clone/pull the repository if you're a part of the team). Then open the project in Android Studio `Project > open > C:...\Folder for projects\gruppe-50-master`.

### Run application in emulator or on Android device

Click on run and when you get to the select target screen, either set up an emulator or connect an Android device both with API 26 or higher. Run the application on your target of choice and the application should be running.
